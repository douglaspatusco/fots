# Flying Over The Sea (Music Band)
[Official Website]: https://fots.com.br


To build this project, I used React, Typescript and Styled Components.

This is a website that aims to showcase the musical work of the band Flying Over The Sea. A metal band from Rio de Janeiro.

It starts with a header that has links to social networks, the band's logo and a menu on the right side. When you hover over the logo, it grows, and when you click on a link in the menu, the page scrolls to the corresponding section.

The page starts with a full-screen video clip ready to play and introduce the user to the band's style.

Next, we have a gallery of video clips, where when you click on the corresponding image, the video opens in a window in the center of the screen, and when you click outside the video, it stops playing and the window closes.

Finally, we have an About Me section, telling a little about the band's history.

And finally, the footer with the band's social media links.
