          Music entered my life when I was a child. My mother would take me to
          church and I was fascinated by the musicians. All I could pay
          attention to was the guitarist, the keyboardist, and especially the
          drummer. I was fascinated by those strangely shaped things making
          sounds.
          <br /> My family's situation was very poor, we could barely afford
          food, and few were the chances for me to take instrument classes.{' '}
          <br />
          <br />
          Around 2005, when I was living with my grandparents, something very
          dangerous happened to me as a rebellious teenager:
          <br />
          <br /> I discovered Metal!
          <br />
          <br /> This memory will never fade. It was late, around 1 am, I had
          school next day but could not sleep because of insomnia. So zapping
          through the channels, I stopped at the now extinct MTV and a music
          video was playing. It was Before I Forget by Slipknot. I was dragged
          into that atmosphere. The next day, I couldn't think of anything else
          but searching the internet to find out more about who those guys were,
          what kind of heavy, fast and dense rhythm was that, full of screams
          that somehow translated what I was feeling. From that day on, my life
          would change forever. <br />
          <br />A year later, I asked my grandmother to sign me in drum class at
          the church. I took classes for 2 years, it was the best part of my
          week since I couldn't afford a drum kit. I can say that my cushions
          and sofa suffered the most. As I discovered new bands and also had no
          idea when I would be able to buy a drum, I felt like learning to play
          guitar and started with the good old acoustic guitar. At mid-2008 I
          was very influenced by Avenged Sevenfold, my second biggest
          inspiration and reference for me to this day. At that time, I was
          already using GuitarPro to write my drum exercises and learn to play
          songs on the guitar.
          <br />
          <br /> In 2012, I would have finished high school, but after a failed
          project I worked in another state, I came back to Rio de Janeiro. I
          worked during the day and at night I met up with friends to drink and
          talk about music. The desire to make music grew, and we almost formed
          a band, “ImpacThrash”, the band that never was. Although the band
          didn't work out, the desire to make music prevailed. <br />
          <br />I knew how to play the drums, I played the guitar, I used Guitar
          Pro, I didn't know much about music theory but I was very
          hard-working, and I was already familiar with the world of virtual
          instruments, so why not create a project where I could put all the
          themes I imagined in my head? <br />
          <br />
          That's when Flying Over The Sea was finally born in 2013. An
          independent Metal music project with influences from heavy, thrash,
          melodic, HC, metalcore and other styles with a Brazilian flair. <br />
          <br />
          The rest is history. <br />
          <br />
          And it is being written.
